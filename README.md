# DeGenPrime-Ez
### Thank you for your interest in DeGenPrime-Ez. This tool is currently in development. 
### If you are looking for a more immediate solution to your primer design woes, consider using our command line tool, (DeGenPrime). [https://github.com/raw-lab/DeGenPrime]

We tried very hard to make this program operational before RECOMB, but we were unfortunately able to do so. Currently, we are working on:
* Rewriting the GUI to be more accessible to those with visual impairments & changing the font size from 12pt to 20pt
* Implementing robust and understandable error handling for those without formal computational experience
* Migrating output file format from a proprietary .dgp file to a more accessible .csv
