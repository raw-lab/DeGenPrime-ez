We tried very hard to make this program operational before RECOMB, but we were unfortunately able to do so. Currently, we are working on:
* Rewriting the GUI to be more accessible to those with visual impairments & changing the font size from 12pt to 20pt
* Implementing robust and understandable error handling for those without formal computational experience
* Migrating output file format from a proprietary .dgp file to a more accessible .csv
